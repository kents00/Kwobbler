This addon is designed to help you easily create and apply a PlayStation 1 (PS1) style effect to your 3D meshes within Blender. The PS1 aesthetic, characterized by low polygon counts, vertex snapping, and pixelated textures, has a nostalgic charm and is popular in various creative projects, from indie games to retro-inspired artworks.

The Kwobbler addon streamlines the process of achieving this distinctive look by providing you with a ready-to-use geometry node setup that can be quickly applied to any mesh in your scene.

**Note: Make sure no objects are selected in your collection, click on the Scene Collection in the outliner, and click the Setup PS1 button in the Kwobbler panel.**

## Features

- **Automatic Node Group Import**: The addon automatically imports the necessary geometry node group for the PS1 effect.
  
- **Easy Setup**: With a single click, create a new collection containing a plane mesh that utilizes the PS1 effect node group.
  
- **Customizable**: Adjust the node group's parameters to fine-tune the PS1 effect to your liking.
